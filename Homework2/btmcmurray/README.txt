This is my first submission (with no widgets) of HW2 using the react template. Hopefully,
if time permits, I will be able to submit the viz with widgets on the page.  

To observe the viz, simply enter the react-d3 directory, and run:

`npm start`

I had to reinstall npm when transferring the react-d3 directory to ./btmcmurray, but it shouldn't be too difficult.
